### App Demo:

## Concept:

For the lovers of the outdoors: This is a site to find National Parks/Monuments that are in a state that you are visiting or live in. Find National Parks, gain basic information of them and add them to a list of favorites where you can add personal notes about that specific place

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* SCSS
* JavaScript 
* JSX
* React
* MongoDB
* Express

##### Credits:

## Approach:

Color Pallet:

#### User stories

The user will see a form to enter in a state abbreviation upon entering the site. After hitting submit, the user will see all available National Parks for that state that pop up. They can then click on each individual place to learn more. Afterwards, they can add to a favorites page and look at all their favorites. The user can add and edit notes on each favorite post.

#### Development Plan 


* Development Plan One:  Create the basic layout of the site
* Development Plan Two: Pull the National Parks API data and display it on the page
* Development Plan Three:  Push the National Parks data into my database once the user favorites an item. 
* Development Plan  Four: Have the user be able to add and edit notes on each individual post.

#### MVP

* MVP ONE: A full working stack with Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React
* MVP Two: At least one model with full CRUD
* MVP Three: Includes one extra feature. I included two models, a third-party API and React Router
* MVP Four: A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, 
installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* MVP Five: Deployed to Heroku

#### Stretch goals

* Stretch goals ONE: Have a better looking layout
* Stretch goals Two: Add a map so people can see where exactly the National Park is
* Stretch goals Three: Fix the bugs in the National Parks Service API before bringing the data to my page
* Stretch goals Four: Create a more responsive layout
## Challenges:

Throughout the project, I faced numerous obstacles which I was able to overcome. The main challenges I faced were being able to display the parks data throughout my multiple different pages as well as being able to create a full CRUD model for just the notes section, since the parks model is not able to be edited
